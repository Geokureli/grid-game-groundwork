## Setting Up Scenes:
- Add the "GameController" prefab to the scene
See "Example.unity"

## Using the Editor:
The editor window can be found under "Window" -> "Level Editor".
- Assign any number of prefabs to the "Prefabs" dropdown (then collapse it when done)
- After selecting a game object (prefab), set the "Scene" view to "2D"
- Left-click anywhere in the scene to paint in the selected gameObject
- Hold left-click to paint continuously 

_Note: Selecting "Empty" will clear any objects at that position._
